<h3 style="color: red">It Ends With Us</h3>
<p>
  This was a good movie. Some parts were kinda cringy theres lots of controversy
  with tis movie because they are promoting it like a romance but it has a lot
  of domestic violence.<br />
  I can see why people are upset.
</p>
<h3 style="color: crimson">Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
<p>
  This movie was very funny. It was of course super inappropriate to children.
  This movie is for adults only. I watched it with my husband.<br />
  There were a lot of references about FOX, Disney and 20th Century I didnt get.
</p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Babes</h3>
<p>
  This movie was about two best friends that end up having babies very close to eachother. I thought this was a very relatable and heartwarming movie.<br/>
  I watched it with one of my best friend's Ashley that has also had a baby two weeks before me.<br/>
  I really liked this movie.
