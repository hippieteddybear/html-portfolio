<p>
  This was a good movie. Some parts were kinda cringy theres lots of controversy
  with tis movie because they are promoting it like a romance but it has a lot
  of domestic violence.<br />
  I can see why people are upset.

<h3 style="color: crimson">Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
<p>
  This movie was very funny. It was of course super inappropriate to children.
  This movie is for adults only. I watched it with my husband.<br />
  There were a lot of references about FOX, Disney and 20th Century I didnt get.
